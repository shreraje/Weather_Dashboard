# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a simple basic weather dashboard application which can show present day weather condition and upcoming 5 days weather forcast using basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and API of openweather.org.

## Experience:
At first, API key is essential piece to develop this application which will help us to communicate with openweather.org/api to get the data of current and future weather forcast with the help of free user friendly queryURL link. "AJAX (method: GET) .then function" was used to approach and get the weather data response which were appended on the webpage. Since, I am still learning, I have used very basic HTML and CSS codes to create a framework for front-end part. All other data informations were displayed on the screen after you search any city by typing on the input form either clicking "Search" button or pressing "ENTER" key. Apart from all these, there is still a lot to improve and learn.
